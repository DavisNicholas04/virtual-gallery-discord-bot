                The theme for our virtual art gallery will be based on space in various media. These media will include
                things such as
                anime, video games, and the history of space travel and exploration in real life. We will use this
                gallery to
                show the differences and similarities between video games and anime versus our real-life history on the
                topic
                of space exploration and space in general.
                Our discord bot will help you find new video games/anime that have to do with space, along with showing
                you
                important events in history that pertain to space travel.

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Humans have always looked up into the night sky and dreamed about touching the stars and exploring our
                universe.

                In the latter half of the 20th century, rockets were developed that were powerful enough to overcome the
                force
                of gravity to reach orbital velocities, paving the way for space exploration to become a reality.
                Humanity has
                managed to land people on the Moon, land robots and probes onto Mars, and managed to send out satellites
                beyond Pluto's orbit.</p>
